# Project 1

## Project preparation

For your first project, you will pick from one of the three following subject matter and create **a schema / breakdown of your tables (in 3NF)** and **a schema / uml for all necessary classes** for the chosen subject matter.

- Food vendor - suppliers (where ingredients comes from), ingredients (including type: meat, vegetables, etc), the dishes (and which ingredients they contain). Make sure pricing is a factor in the whole chain from supply to the dishes.

- Computer Builder - parts from different brands, part compatibility (ex: amd, intel, mac) and of course pricing. Make sure there are enough information to help ID and build a complete system with no missing or redundant / duplicate parts.

- Pet store - species of pets, the different breeds (mixed or pure), toys for different pets and of course, pricing for the pets and the toys.

Create a folder called `project-1` and add it to github.
